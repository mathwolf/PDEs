%   Math 550 Homework 2 #1
%   FEM for boundary value problem
%
%   Input:  
%   partition   a vector  of n real numbers, each lying in the interval
%               (0,1), the list should be sequential
%   evaluation_points
%               a set of points in [0,1] where we
%               will compare results

N = length(partition);      % number of mesh points off the boundary

F = zeros(N+1,1);
for i = 1:N+1
    F(i) =
